# P5.js-Pong
1 / 2 player pong game written in p5.js

It's like pong but the ball gets progressively faster. If played in single player mode, use the left & right arrow keys to move and the up key to launch the ball. The opponent will level up its speed with every win you score.
In multiplayer mode, the second player can use WASD to control the top bar.
The score in the center of the screen indicates the ever increasing speed of the ball.
